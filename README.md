# configuration-by-argument

Send the path to your json-file in command arguments. And yes, it's yet another configuration module.

* Easy and simple to use.
* Load different configurations for different environments. 
* Load multiple configuration files.

# Usage

## Always do this:

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the module:

```
	npm install configuration-by-argument
```

Then use `require()` to load it in your code:

```javascript
	var configurationByArgument = require('configuration-by-argument');
```

And now for some programming :-)

## In the simplest form

Declare a new instance and load the configuration.

```javascript
	var cba = new configurationByArgument();

	var config = cba.get();
```

If you have a file named myconfig.json in the root of your directory, and your program is called load-config.js, you can start node like this:
```
	node load-config --config myconfig.json
```

## File in a sub directory

If you file is not in the root of your application, you can give a relative path to the file as an argument.

```
	node load-config --config configs/myconfig.json
```


## Double trouble

What if you have more than one configuration file?

Well, you can set the name of the parameter that contains a path to you file.

```
	node load-config --config1 one.json --configForTesting two.json
```

```javascript
	var cba;
	cba1 = new configurationByArgument({ parameterKey: "config1" });

	var config1 = cba.get();

	cba2 = new configurationByArgument({ parameterKey: "configForTesting" });

	var config2 = cba.get();
```

## Just set that configuration... please

If you have loaded a configuration from another source you can load it directly into configuration-by-argument like this.

```javascript
	var configIn = '{ "myProp": "OK" }';
			
	var cba = new configurationByArgument();
	cba.set(configIn);
	var config = cba.get();
```

"Now, why would I do that? It will just return the same object as the one I provided".

True, but if it's a string, you will get it back as an object.
Okay, weak a point there... You could just use JSON.parse.

BUT it enables you to make use of the "required"-attribute. That's will allow the module to throw an error if a certain property doesn't exist.

## Options

You can set some options on configuration-by-argument by sending them to the constructor upon initialization.

```javascript
	var cba = new configurationByArgument({}); //send your options in JSON
```

### required
