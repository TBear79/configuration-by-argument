# configuration-by-argument

Send the path to your json-file in command arguments. And yes, it's yet another configuration module.

* Easy and simple to use.
* Load different configurations based on command arguments. 
* Load multiple configuration files.
* Validate the config-file using [jsonschema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonschema)

# Usage

## First install the module:

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the module:

```
	npm install configuration-by-argument
```

And now for some programming :-)

## In the simplest form

Declare a new instance and load the configuration.

```javascript
	var cba = new configurationByArgument();

	var config = cba.get();
```

If you have a file named myconfig.json in the root of your directory, and your program is called load-config.js, you can start node like this:
```
	node load-config --config myconfig.json
```

## File in a sub directory

If your file is not in the root of your application, you can give a relative path to the file as an argument.

```
	node load-config --config configs/myconfig.json
```


## Double trouble

What if you have more than one configuration file?

Well, you can set the name of the parameter that contains a path to your file.

```
	node load-config --config1 one.json --configForTesting two.json
```

```javascript
	var cba;
	cba1 = new configurationByArgument({ parameterKey: "config1" });

	var config1 = cba.get();

	cba2 = new configurationByArgument({ parameterKey: "configForTesting" });

	var config2 = cba.get();
```


## Options

You can set some options on configuration-by-argument by sending them to the constructor upon initialization.

```javascript
	var cba = new configurationByArgument({}); //send your options in JSON
```

### validationSchemas

Array of JSON objects OR just a JSON object.

Default: []

Send a schema to validate the config-file against. This is done by jsonschema. See documentation [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonschema).
When sending an array of schema references, make sure that the base-schema is in position 0.

### parameterKey

String.

Default: "config"

The name of the config-parameter. If you want to send paths to more thant one config-file, you have to give the others arguments difference names.
See the example near the top for this.

### errorHandler

Function.

Override the default error handler by passing your own function in this property.

The default errorhandler looks like this:
```javascript
	function(ex) {
        throw ex;
    }
```

# Tests

Uses mocha.

To run tests on this module, make sure that the modules for the tests are installed

```
	npm install configuration-by-argument --dev
```

Then run:

```
	npm test
```
